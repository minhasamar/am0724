This is a simple REST API service build with the Spring boot framework. The idea is to code and test a simple tool rental application.

*  The application is a point-of-sale tool for a store, like Home Depot, that rents big tools.
*  Customers rent a tool for a specified number of days.
*  When a customer checks out a tool, a Rental Agreement is produced.
*  The store charges a daily rental fee, whose amount is different for each tool type.
*  Some tools are free of charge on weekends or holidays.
*  Clerks may give customers a discount that is applied to the total daily charges to reduce the final charge.
